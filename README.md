# Automatic-Review-Analyzer

This project will be used to design a classifer to use for sentiment analysis of product reviews. The training set is based on reviews written by Amazon customers for a variety food products.

The reviews have been adjusted to a +/- 1 scale from a 5-point scale, represented +1 for a positive review, -1 for a negative review.

The dataset has both the review and its associated label.

Three linear classifiers are used to test highest performance: perceptron algorithm, average perceptron algorithm, and Pegasos algorithm.
